# Housing Affordability and Rising Homelessness in Ontario<br>

## Problem Context <br>

Affording housing in Ontario has transformed into a significant social and economic challenge, particularly in regions such as Hamilton, Ottawa, and of course Toronto. In the past ten years the prices of housing and rental property have gone up, but the wages have stayed the same. This means that a large population now suffers from housing insecurity and homelessness has become a common occurrence, along with reliance on shelters and encampments forming in the major towns. As of 2024, more than 268,000 households are on waitlists for affordable housing, and the number of people experiencing homelessness has increased by over 25% since 2022 (AMO, 2025). People are facing the following issues: increasing housing costs, limited social supports, and a shortage of affordable housing. The evidence shows that there has been an increase in homelessness which signifies that there is a requirement for long term and sustainable interventions (School of Cities, 2024). <br>

By examining and analyzing the different factors that contribute to affordable housing in Ontario, the need of change becomes more significant. The research will investigate how the rate of rent, home buying, income levels, and government funding impacts the overall rate of homelessness. The study will transform all its findings into actionable plans in reducing homelessness and providing affordable housing for everyone in the province. The study will aim to understand the change of patterns within homelessness and how Ontario’s numbers continue to grow, and individuals are left with nowhere to live. The study will aim to analyze the key drivers, as well as if the government policies are significant enough to help the issue.<br>          
 
## Significance of Study:<br>
The provincial issue of housing affordability and homelessness in Ontario is becoming a crisis as many individuals are being pushed into housing insecurity due to inflation and insufficient earnings. This study is unique because it aims to shed light on the phenomena of Ontario and provide useful information on what features drive this crisis, along with assessing the policies employed by the government towards mitigation of homelessness.<br>

## Outcomes of this study<br>
1. Determining the success of the policies<br>
     – Understanding if the government housing schemes, funded programs, or any subsidy provision are effective or if something else is              required to combat this worsening situation. <br>
   
2. Enabling comprehensive policy responses to housing issues<br>
     – Finding any policies that will mitigate homelessness and provide affordable housing at the same time instead of revolving around              waiting for shelters or other emergency solutions. <br>
  
3. Guiding urban and public policy<br>
     – Allowing leaders to municipal and provincial levels to make precise decisions on funding allocation to remediate housing insecurity.          <br>
   
4. Highlighting the issues of housing inequality<br>
     – Showing how high housing cost and inadequate wage growth coupled with a lack of social welfare are increasing inequality and housing          instability as an entire in Ontario.<br>

## Reseach Objectives:
1. to address the issue of accessible housing, further policy changes should be considered, such as greater investment in social housing development or social assistance programs, along with offering motivation backed by data. Improvement regarding affordability housing also requires adequate funding.<br>
   
2. Analyze costs related to renting, homeownership, income, and selected cities like Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa so that housing affordability patterns across Ontario are better understood.<br>
   
3. Focus on existing policies to understand if interventions put in place regarding the homelessness crisis are effective in mitigating such issues. Explore and analyze the connection between current policies in place and the rate of homelessness.<br>
   
4. Examine affordability, social assistance funding, and gaps in availability to find out how housing expenditure and construction works in the vicinity of gaps in social needs security.<br>
