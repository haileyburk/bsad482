# Housing Affordability and Rising Homelessness in Ontario<br>

## Problem Context

Affording housing in Ontario has transformed into a significant social and economic challenge, particularly in regions such as Hamilton, Ottawa, and of course Toronto(AMO, 2025)</mark>. This means that a large population now suffers from housing insecurity and homelessness has become a common occurrence, along with reliance on shelters and encampments forming in the major towns. As of 2024, more than 268,000 households are on waitlists for affordable housing, and the number of people experiencing homelessness has increased by over 25% since 2022 (AMO, 2025). People are facing the following issues: increasing housing costs, limited social supports, and a shortage of affordable housing. The evidence shows that there has been an increase in homelessness which signifies that there is a requirement for long term and sustainable interventions (School of Cities, 2024). <br>

By examining and analyzing the different factors that contribute to affordable housing in Ontario, the need of change become more possible</mark>. The research will investigate how the rate of rent, home buying, income levels, and government funding all correlates with homelessness.</mark> the overall rate of homelessness. The study will aim to understand the change of patterns within homelessness and how Ontario’s numbers continue to grow, and individuals are left with nowhere to live. The study will aim to analyze the key relationships/interplay between variables</mark> , as well as if the government policies are likely to play a role in addressing the issue.<mark>there are interesting **system dynamics** here, and we will cover that soon in class, this might be a great example</mark><br>
